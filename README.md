# Syntecxhub_Project_Student-Management-system
A simple and efficient Command-Line Student Management System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project allows users to add, update, delete, and list student records with ease. Each student has a name, unique ID, and grade, and all records are stored safely in a CSV/JSON file for persistence.
