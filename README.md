# Syntecxhub_Project_Student-Management-system
A simple and efficient Command-Line Student Management System built using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This project allows users to add, update, delete, and list student records with ease. Each student has a name, unique ID, and grade, and all records are stored safely in a CSV/JSON file for persistence.


🔹 Key Features

Add New Students
Store student details with validation to ensure unique student IDs.

-Update Existing Records
Modify name or grade while keeping the ID intact.

-Delete Students
Remove a student record cleanly from the system.

-List All Students
Display formatted output of all stored student details.

-File Persistence (CSV/JSON)
Automatically saves and loads data so records remain available on restart.

-Object-Oriented Design
Uses Student and StudentManager classes to encapsulate data and operations.
